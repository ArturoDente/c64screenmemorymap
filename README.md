# c64screenmemorymap
A html wiritten - self contained c64 screen editor to design simple levels in c64 basic v2.
The editor output shows which cells are on and which off via a string representing active cells indexes in a csv flavour (indexes in 0-999, eventually you add 1024)
The basic code is intended to print the level on c64,reading data provided by the output frame. 
Now improved with a morecomprehensive output on video of what you'll get with the basic code .
